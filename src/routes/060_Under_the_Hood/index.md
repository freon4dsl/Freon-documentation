# Under the Hood

Before you dive deeper under the hood of this project, we invite you to read about the
[philosophy and design guidelines](/010_Intro/philosophy) used during the creation of this tool.

With these in mind, you are welcome to find out more. This section can be roughly divided into three parts.

1. Information about the core [framework](010_The_Editor_Framework) of ProjectIt, the classes that
   are used to build the editors.
2. Information on the [interfaces of all pi-tools](020_The_PiTool_Interfaces), e.g. the scoper, the validator,
   used and generated by ProjectIt.
3. Information on the [(open) source code of ProjectIt](030_Source_Code_Documentation). The code it self can 
   be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt" />
