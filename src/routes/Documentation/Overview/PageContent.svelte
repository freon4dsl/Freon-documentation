<p>
	Freon is a Language Workbench, a tool for creating mini-languages, which are also known as <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific*language"
		target="_blank">Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)</a
	>. Freon generates an integrated set of editor, scoper, typer, and validator for your mini-language from a small set of definitions.
	Together we call this the work environment for your language.
</p>
<p>
	The core of Freon is a <strong>TypeScript/JavaScript</strong> framework for building web-based,
	<a href="/Background/Projectional_Editing">projectional</a>
	editors. Editing expressions in a projectional editor is a well-known challenge. What makes the Freon framework unique is the fact that it
	has built-in support for expressions, so you can easily make a projectional editor that allows for a natural manner of editing.
</p>
<p>
	We assume that people who want to use Freon know at least the basics of making mini-languages. For instance, the terms metamodel, abstract
	syntax tree, scope, concrete syntax, parsing, etc., should be familiar. If you are not, please first refer to other sources, for instance
	the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/building-user-friendly-dsls" target="_blank">â€˜Building User-Friendly DSLsâ€™</a> written by
	Meinte Boersma. If you just need to refresh your knowledge, refer to <a href="/Documentation/Terminology">Freon Terminology</a>.
	Furthermore, a little knowledge of UML will come in handy, but this is not a true requirement.
</p>
<p>
	To be clear about the distinction, on this site, when we address the Freon user, we call him/her a <strong>language engineer</strong>. The
	people that will be using the generated work environment are simply called <strong>users</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	So welcome, language engineer, to the world of Freon. This documentation is meant for you. It explains how Freon can help you in creating
	a language, and building a work environment for it. If you have questions that are not answered in this documentation, please get in
	contact with the Freon team, for instance via email at <em>info AT freon4dsl.dev</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>
