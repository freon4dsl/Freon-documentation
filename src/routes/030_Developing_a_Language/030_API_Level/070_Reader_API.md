# # Third Level Customization of the Reader and Writer

The reader (parser) and writer (unparser) can not yet be 
customized **per concept**. Instead, you can replace the whole
reader or writer by one create yourself.
The new reader needs to implement the following interface.


```ts
TODO add reader interface
```

The new writer needs to implement the following interface.

```ts
TODO add writer interface
```
