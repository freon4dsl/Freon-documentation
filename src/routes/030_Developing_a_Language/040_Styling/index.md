# Styling

Because it is possible to use the generated editor within your own website, there are two separate styling methods. 

* One for styling the [editor](/030_Developing_a_Language/040_Styling/010_Editor_Styling), and 
* one for styling the [web app](/030_Developing_a_Language/040_Styling/020_Webapp_Styling) 
surrounding the editor.
