As most gods used a body very similar to a human body, both species mingled\n\tvery easily. Nor did they find any difficulty in communicating with each other, as they ‚Äútalked‚Äù using psychic brain waves, sometimes\n\taccompanied by gestures or sounds. When, for instance, someone wanted to say: ‚Äúlook at that beautiful flower over there‚Äù, a pointing\n\tgesture would help to determine which flower was the subject of attention. Or when someone yelled out: ‚Äúwatch out for that crocodile‚Äù, a\n\tsound would express the fear and shock. Whatever form the communication would take, both humans and gods understood each other perfectly.\n\tIt was in these times when the earth was young, that the story of Freon, the God of languages, began.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFreon was a small God child. He had a very outgoing character, and befriended strangers with a natural ease and charm. (Or rather he still\n\tdoes, being a God he is of course eternal, and character is known to be highly adverse to change.) Being a curious child Freon was very\n\tinterested in the sounds that were made when people were talking. He noticed that many people used the same sounds for expressing the same\n\tthing. For instance, the sound ‚Äúoh‚Äù was often used when one was surprised, were ‚Äúah‚Äù was used in case of fatigue, and a longer ‚Äúaaahh‚Äù\n\taccompanied pain. In his childlike playful way Freon started to invent sounds for certain expressions, and he and his friends used these\n\tinstead of the psychic communication as their special, secret way of communicating.\n</p>\n<Figure imageName={'background/writing-child.png'} caption={'Is this Freon?'} figureNumber={1} />\n<p>\n\tAfter a few ages, in which Freon grew up just a little but his human friends came and went, generation after generation, Freon had created\n\tmany sounds. He even came up with a sound for the sounds that were made. He called his sounds ‚Äúwords‚Äù, and the sets of words he assembled,\n\the called ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù. With friends in one place he would use one ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù, with friends on the other side of earth, or in another time,\n\the would use another.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a few heavenly moments, which took about three ages on earth, Freon‚Äôs father, the leader of the gods, noticed that the humans relied\n\tmore and more on the sounds, and less on the psychic form of communication. In fact, the humans were losing the ability to understand each\n\tother without aid of sound or gestures all together. So Freon‚Äôs father told him to stop making ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù and ‚Äúfor heaven‚Äôs sake speak\n\tnormally from now on‚Äù. Freon reacted like the teenager he was at that time, telling his father not to act like an old demented human, and\n\tthat he, Freon, would do exactly what he liked.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen his father insisted, pulling rank - he was the leader of the gods, after all - Freon went to complain to his mother. Unfortunately\n\tfor Freon, she agreed with his father. ‚ÄúTake pity on the humans‚Äù, she said, ‚Äúthey already suffered enough from the deluge. You remember,\n\tdon‚Äôt you, Noah and his Arc. They have lost so much because of your father‚Äôs anger, don‚Äôt make them lose their ability to know and\n\tunderstand as well.‚Äù Of course Freon argued, but she was not to be persuaded. At the end of the day, Freon went away from the earth, out\n\tof time and space, back to his heavenly bedroom, pining.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFreon was resentful, so he devised a plan to taunt his parents. In the next few weeks, (if you can call it weeks, outside of time) without\n\this parents knowing, he went back to earth. This time (no pun intended, it‚Äôs simply difficult to communicate heavenly time to humans) he\n\tused his godly abilities to enter earth in a certain time and at a certain place. He went to places and times where he knew that his\n\tformer human friends were, and he contacted them a few at a time. At every occasion he taught the group of humans a word to name the\n\tleader of the gods and his spouse. The genius of the plan was that he taught them a different name at every occasion. In one time and\n\tcorner of the world, it was Zeus and Hera. In another it was Indra and Shachi, then Jupiter and Juno, and in the north it was Wodan and\n\tFrigg.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tActually, the north was the first part of the earth that Freon visited, when he was still very angry with his parents. And the north\n\twinters being so cold and dark, the people had ot much else to do than listen to stories. In this particular winter Freon used more than a\n\thundred different names for his father. All very good names, the name Fimbultyr, for instance, means ‚Äúmighty god‚Äù. Freon never stooped to\n\tname-calling. But later Freon wondered if he might not have overdone things a bit.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter a while, his mother noticed that Freon often left home secretly, had a word with him, and managed to get the whole story out of him.\n\tInternally smiling at her son‚Äôs mischief, she nevertheless grounded him for one heavenly month, that is thirty rest periods. Freon knew he\n\tcouldn‚Äôt escape his mother‚Äôs attention, as she would be using her godly ability to know all he did, so he simply tried to rest as often as\n\the could, thus getting the whole thing over as soon as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, on earth, people argued who was the top God. Some said Zeus, others Indra, others Wodan, and things soon became nasty. Blows\n\twere exchanged, brothers and sisters were no longer speaking with each, neighbours weren‚Äôt neighbourly no more. In a few ages - this all\n\thappened while Freon was grounded in his heavenly room - the whole world got out of control. There were so many disputes that finally the\n\tpeople of the town of Babel decided to ask the God himself by what name they should pray to him. Unfortunately, at that time the gods did\n\tnot frequent the earth anymore, they had acquired a bit of a ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù kind of attitude. So how to contact the gods?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, the people of Babel decided to build a tower that would be high enough to reach the heavens. Unfortunately for them, Freon‚Äôs\n\tdifferent languages had spread amongst them, ending in a huge misunderstanding between the builders. The foundation of the tower was not\n\tstrong enough to take the weight of the building, and the whole thing collapsed. Many human lives were lost.\n</p>\n<Figure imageName={'background/tower-of-babel.png'} caption={'Tower of Babel'} figureNumber={2} />\n<p>\n\tThis disaster naturally was brought to the attention of Freon‚Äôs father. He sent out his ministers to investigate and when all of them in\n\ttheir reports mentioned Freon in one way or another, he called his son to his office. Freon knew that this was serious. The office was\n\twhere important matters were dealt with, and Freon had never before been summoned there. The story doesn‚Äôt tell what was said exactly. His\n\tfather and Freon agreed that it should better stay between them, and both have kept this agreement up to this day.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, since that day the leader of the gods called his son Freon, meaning <i>wise friend</i>. Because - as he explained later to his\n\tministers - Freon needed to be reminded that being a god meant that he should be wise, at least wiser than a human, and that he should be\n\ta friend to the humans and help them along in their short lives. And in the ministerial council that followed, Freon was officially\n\tcharged with helping humans overcome the misunderstanding that followed from the birth of the languages.\n</p>\n<p>And that is how Freon became the God of languages.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(Author: Anneke Kleppe)</p>\n\n<PrevNextSection {prevLink} {nextLink} />\n","<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport { mySections } from
