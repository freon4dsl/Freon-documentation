					framework. With Freon, language engineers can define a language&#39;s structure, editor, scoper, typer, and validator—all from a
					concise set of definitions. By leveraging the power of projectional editing, Freon enables a smooth and intuitive development
					process, making it easier to build custom editing environments for specialized languages.</p> <p class="see-me">Whether you&#39;re developing a DSL for a niche domain or designing a specialized tool for your organization, Freon provides the
					flexibility and scalability you need to quickly bring your ideas to life. Start creating your own custom language workbench with
					Freon today, and take advantage of its open-source framework and growing set of features to stay ahead in the world of web-based
					language development.</p> <p>At the heart of Freon lies a robust framework accompanied by five specialized generators, each dedicated to a crucial aspect of
					your language&#39;s work environment:</p> <ul><li>Language Structure: Define the core concepts, properties, and relationships inherent to your language.</li> <li>Editor: Customize the visual representation and editing commands, ensuring a user-friendly interface.</li> <li>Scoper: Establish rules for name resolution, managing references within your language models.</li> <li>Typer: Determine the types associated with language elements, enforcing consistency and correctness.</li> <li>Validator: Set validation rules to ensure models adhere to defined constraints, providing real-time feedback.</li></ul> <p>Join us in shaping the future of DSL development by exploring Freon today!</p></div>`,k,d,C=`<a href="/Documentation/Overview/Getting_Started" class="landing-enter-button"><h3>Getting Started</h3> <p>Want to get started immediately... this is the place to go.

						Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) product. CRCs are the front-line staff that perform clinical trials for drugs and other
						health products. See
						<a href="/Background/Testimonial" class=".landing-testimonial-more">CRCHub Application</a>
						for an explanation of the product and some samples of the product UI. A DSL platform that is optimized for the Web is the void in
						today’s DSL technology. Having built DSLs using primitive tools like parsers and language servers as well as high-end tools like
						MPS, our assessment is that Freon is well on the way to being the ideal balance between these extremes. Freon’s break through is
						its Web-first architecture which allowed us to seamlessly integrate the DSL technology with a modern web application. The path for
						integration with the LionWeb project positions Freon for even the most complex projects. Key features of Freon that we used:</p> <ul><li>Its DSL language for CRC DSL</li> <li>Its DSL editor framework for the entry of the DSL</li> <li>Its interpreter framework to run simulations of the scheduling</li> <li>Its storage framework to load and save the data.</li></ul> <p>The Freon team has been wonderfully responsive to us when we were getting started and as we’ve made ever more advanced requests
						for new features. We would highly recommend using Freon on a DSL project and would be happy to speak with anyone looking to
						discuss our experience with Freon.</p> <a href="/Background/Testimonial" class=".landing-testimonial-more"><p>Learn more...</p></a></div></div>`,_,c,b;return n=new G({}),c=new P({}),{c(){e=h("main"),M(n.$$.fragment),s=m(),t=h("div"),r=h("section"),r.innerHTML=F,T=m(),l=h("section"),l.innerHTML=D,k=m(),d=h("section"),d.innerHTML=C,S=m(),g=h("section"),g.innerHTML=I,_=m(),M(c.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(a){e=u(a,"MAIN",{class:!0});var p=$(e);E(n.$$.fragment,p),s=f(p),t=u(p,"DIV",{class:!0});var o=$(t);r=u(o,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(r)!=="svelte-1syev02"&&(r.innerHTML=F),T=f(o),l=u(o,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(l)!=="svelte-1vio4ct"&&(l.innerHTML=D),k=f(o),d=u(o,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(d)!=="svelte-jwlw1j"&&(d.innerHTML=C),S=f(o),g=u(o,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(g)!=="svelte-lutos0"&&(g.innerHTML=I),_=f(o),E(c.$$.fragment,o),o.forEach(L),p.forEach(L),this.h()},h(){v(r,"class","landing-herosection"),v(l,"class","landing-main-text"),v(d,"class","landing-enter-buttons-grid"),v(t,"class","content-box"),v(e,"class","main-window")},m(a,p){z(a,e,p),H(n,e,null),i(e,s),i(e,t),i(t,r),i(t,T),i(t,l),i(t,k),i(t,d),i(t,S),i(t,g),i(t,_),H(c,t,null),b=!0},p:y,i(a){b||(W(n.$$.fragment,a),W(c.$$.fragment,a),b=!0)},o(a){R(n.$$.fragment,a),R(c.$$.fragment,a),b=!1},d(a){a&&L(e),j(n),j(c)}}}class U extends A{constructor(e){super(),B(this,e,null,q,O,{})}}export{U as component};
