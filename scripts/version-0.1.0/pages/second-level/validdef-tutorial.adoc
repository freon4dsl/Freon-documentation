= The Validator Definition

== Three-level definition
As explained in xref:../intro/three-levels.adoc#levels[Three-levels to Define your Pi-tools]
the generated validator can
be defined in three levels.
For each *concept* in the AST the validator will

// TODO Doesn't the validator comcine all three levels?
. use the _hand-made validation rule(s)_, when present. Otherwise the validator will
. use to the _validation rule(s) generated from the validator definition_, when this definition is present.
Finally, the validator will
. use the xref:default[_default validation rule(s)_].

The rest of this tutorial explains the second level: how to write a validator definition (`.valid` file).

== The Validator Definition File
The validator definition defines the constraints that should be true in the models build by your users. Currently,
there are four types of rules.

=== Valid Identifier Rules

Given a simple property of type string, a _valid-identifier-rule_ can be given. The property complies with the
rule if it is a valid identifier according to the TypeScript definition.
[indent=1]
For a _valid-identifier-rule_ the `validIdentifier` keyword is used followed by an optional simple property. When the
property is present, this property is checked. When the property is not present, ProjectIt assumes that the
concept has a simple property named ‘`name`’ of type ‘`string`’, and it will check this property.

=== Simple Value Rules
Given a simple property, its value can be limited to certain values.

=== List Rules
Given a list property, a _not-empty rule_ can be stated. The list complies with the rule if it is not empty.

Given a list property, an _is-unique rule_ can be stated on a property of the elements in the list. The list
complies when the value of the property is unique for every element in the list.

=== Type Check Rules
Given the rules in the typer definition, rules can be stated to ensure type compliance.
To indicate a _type checking rule_ the keyword `typecheck` is used, followed by either `equalsType` or `conformsTo`.
The first demands that the types of the two properties given are equal. The second demands that the type of the first
conforms to the type of the second.

In the type checking rules it is possible to use predefined instances of a limited concept.

== The Default Validation Rules

There are just a few default validation rules:

. Non optional properties must be set.
. Non optional lists must include one element.
. Names of model units should be valid identifiers.
