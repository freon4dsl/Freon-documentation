= What is Projectional Editing?

The essential characteristic of projectional editing is that the user manipulates
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) directly, instead of the tradional manner in which
the user manipulates a text (string), which is then parsed into a (changed) AST. For a generic view
on projectional editing see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor[wikipedia,window=_blank].

The overall flow in a projectional editor generated by ProjectIt is as follows:

1. The model/AST is mapped to a visual presentation (the projection).
2. The projection is shown to the user.
3. The user performs an action on the projection.
4. The action on the projection is mapped to an action on the model/AST.
5. (or 1 again) The changed model/AST is (re)mapped to a visual representation.

Typical user actions are to _create_ a new element in the AST, to _change_ the content of an element,
or to _delete_ an element.

Certainly, these changes may need to be persisted. When the user triggers
the actions _save_ or _open_ the AST is pushed to or retrieved from a server.
