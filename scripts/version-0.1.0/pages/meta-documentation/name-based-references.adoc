= Name-Based References

// TODO should this page also be moved to the introduction section?
In xref:../intro/expressions.adoc[Support for Expressions] we explain that editing expressions is a known challenge
for projectional editors. A second challenge is posed by _references_, which is stated in https://www.voelter.de/data/pub/fse2016-projEditing.pdf[Efficiency of Projectional Editing:
A Controlled Experiment] as follows.

[quote, Markus Voelter a.o., Efficiency of Projectional Editing]
____
*References.*
References are based on pointers to the targetnodeâ€™s ID. Despite some advantages (e.g., robust
refactorings) of this approach, we observe problems with the tradeoff that the reference target
has to exist at the time the reference is created.  A more robust and intuitive handling of
references is desirable.  While some problems can be solved by language developers (e.g.,
quick fixes to create reference targets), there should be a better way to support references
by the IDE itself.

The approach to references in ProjectIt is to used only name-based references which are resolve
on a need-to basis.
____

== All References are Name-Based
In ProjectIt we allow only name-based references. Every reference is an instance of `PiElementReference`,
which holds:

. the name of the referred element
. the meta-type of the referred element
. a cache of the element itself

This means that the AST is truly a tree, not a graph.

The advantage is that we are not obliged to have the complete model in memory. Our use of
multi-file models is explained in xref:../intro/modelunits.adoc#modelunits[Models and Model Units].
