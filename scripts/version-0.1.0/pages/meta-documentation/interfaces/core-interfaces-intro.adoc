= The ProjectIt Core Interfaces

There are two series of interfaces that make ProjectIt and its generated code extensible and flexible. The first
series are the xref:../tools-interfaces/tools-interfaces-intro.adoc[interfaces of the generated code].

The second series of interfaces are those that define parts of the core of the ProjectIt framework:

. xref:projection-interface.adoc[PiProjection]
. xref:action-interface.adoc[PiActions]
. xref:expression-interface.adoc[PiExpression]
. xref:binary-expression-interface.adoc[PiBinaryExpression]

In both series the following two interfaces are used:

. xref:element-interface.adoc[PiElement]
. xref:named-element-interface.adoc[PiNamedElement]
