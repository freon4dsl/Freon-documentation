= PiProjection

The projection from your model/AST is defined by implementing the _PiProjection_ interface:

[source]
----
include::{src-dir}/editor/PiProjection.ts[tag=PiProjection]
----

Implementing this interface should return a _Box_ for each `element` in the AST.
ProjectIt includes boxes of various types (textual, tabular, horizontal or vertical collections, etc.)
to define this projection.
The box model is further described in the xref:../framework/editor-framework.adoc[editor framework].
