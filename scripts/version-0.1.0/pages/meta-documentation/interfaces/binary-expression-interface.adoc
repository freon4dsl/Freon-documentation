=  PiBinaryExpression

An object that implements `PiBinaryExpression` can be a node in the model AST. It represents
an expression that has exactly two operands, which are usually written to the left and right of
the operator symbol. For example, '4+5'.

This interface extends the xref:expression-interface.adoc[`PiExpression`] interface.
