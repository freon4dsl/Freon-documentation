= The Pi-tool Interfaces

There are two series of interfaces that make ProjectIt and its generated code extensible and flexible. The first
series are the interfaces implemented by the generated code:

. xref:environment-interface.adoc[PiEnvironment]
. xref:scoper-interface.adoc[PiScoper]
. xref:validator-interface.adoc[PiValidator]
. xref:typer-interface.adoc[PiTyper]
. xref:reader-interface.adoc[PiReader]
. xref:writer-interface.adoc[PiWriter]
. xref:standardlib-interface.adoc[PiStdlib]

The second series of interfaces are those that define parts of the
xref:../interfaces/core-interfaces-intro.adoc[core of the ProjectIt framework].
