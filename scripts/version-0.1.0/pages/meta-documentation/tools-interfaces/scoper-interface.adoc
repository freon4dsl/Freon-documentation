=  PiScoper

An object that implements `PiScoper` is able to return the named elements that are visible
for a certain AST node. This node can be a 'normal' model element or it can be a namespace.
If the node is a 'normal' element, the names visbible in its (lexical) surrounding namespace
are returned.

If you want to write your own scoper you will need to implement this interface.
