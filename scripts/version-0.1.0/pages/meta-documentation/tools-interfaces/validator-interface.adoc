=  PiValidator

An object that implements `PiValidator` is able to validate a node in the AST. The
validation can be only on the node itself or it can include all child-nodes resursively.

The errors that are found are returned in the form of a list of `PiError` objects. Every `PiError`
holds a message and a reference to the node that is faulty.

If you want to write your own validator you will need to implement this interface.
