= Boxes

A Box is an abstract class describing the features that are common for all boxes.
As explained in the xref:editor-framework.adoc[editor framework], each box has a mandatory model element and role.
The following boxes are available.

|===
|Primitive Boxes|Grouping Boxes

|LabelBox | HorizontalListBox
|TextBox | VerticalListBox

|TextBox| GridBox

|SpacerBox|VerticalPiElementListBox
|AliasBox|
|===

== LabelBox
A `LabelBox` shows a non-editable text.
The text itself can either be a fixed string (1), or it can be defined as a function (2).
Being a function allows the label text to change dynamically,
depending on the result value of the function.

[source]
....
new LabelBox(element, "role", "fixed text")         <1>
new LabelBox(element, "role", () => element.value)  <2>
....

== TextBox
A `TextBox` shows an editable text.
In addition to the element and the role a text box needs two function parameters.
The first function to get the value of the text,
the second function to set the value of the text.

[source]
----
new TextBox(
    element,
    "role",
    () => element.stringValue,
    (newValue: string) => element.stringValue = newValue
)
----

There are two options you can set for a `TextBox`:

These options control what happens when a textbox becomes empty, i.e. contains no characters.

== SvgBox
An `SvgBox` shows a single SVG image.

== ListBox
A `ListBox` is a list of child boxes, either horizontally or vertically.
The ListBox itself is abstract.

=== HorizontalListBox
A `HorizontalListBox` show a list of child boxes next to each other horizontally.

An example of using a `HorizontalListBox` is the following that represents the
projection of a StringLiteral.

include::{src-dir}/test/testeditor/CoreTestProjection.ts[tag=StringLiteral]

=== VerticalListBox
A `VerticalListBox` show a list of child boxes next to each other vertically.

It's usage is similar to that of the `HorizontalListBox`.

=== VerticalModelElementListBox
A `VerticalModelElementListBox` show a list of PiElement objects,
where each ModelElement will be shown according to its defined projection.

This box is a special case of a VerticalListBox, to show a list
of child elements.
A special property of this type of box is the `elementCreator()`.
This is a function thet should create a new element that fits in the collection.
Given this, the VerticalModelElementListBox generates the editor
for the element list, including the neccesary behavior to add and remove elements from the list.

== GridBox
A `GridBox` is used to show boxes in a tabular fashion.
// TODO document GridBox

== SelectBox
A `SelectBox` is used to show a selection to the user.
// TODO document SelectBox

== AliasBox
An `AliasBox` is a box where the user can type text (printable characters),
which is used as an alias for some action.
// TODO document AliasBox
