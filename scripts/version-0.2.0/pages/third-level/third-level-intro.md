# Third Level Customization

Please, become acquainted with the (/010_Intro/050_Three_Levels_of_Customization[Three levels to Customize ProjectIt] used by ProjectIt.
This section explains the 3rd of these three levels where you can customize ProjectIt in TypeScript..

## Customize a Pi-tool
Third level full adaptability **per concept* is currently possible for:

* xref:./editor-third-level[Editor]
* xref:./validator-third-level[Validator]

To add third level adaptability for both scoper and typer is one of the
entries in our (/010_Intro/wish-list[wish list].

## Replacing a Pi-tool
All parts can be *completely replaced* at the 3rd level, thereby completely
disregarding the 1st and 2nd level..
This is done by implementing their respective interfaces.

For the scoper and typer this is currently the only way to customize.

* xref:./typer-third-level[typer]
* xref:./scoper-third-level[scoper]
