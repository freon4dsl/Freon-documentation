IN version 0.5.0 the theming does not function. Therefore, I adjusted the colors in global.css by hand. 
But dark mode does not function in the live website at all. Maybe due to GitHub pages????

[//]: # (TODO!!!)
- [ ] Use of url to supply model parameter: http://localhost:5000/?model=Layout1

Still to do in the documentation:

- [ ] improve pictures in 'projectional-editing.adoc'
- [ ] make screenshots of the editor for every edit-def example
- [ ] check the images in framework-tutorial.adoc
- [ ] JOS: rewrite the third-level pages on custom build projections and actions
- [ ] JOS: add location of tutorial custom build projections in source code
- [ ] JOS: write documentation on support for expressions
- [ ] JOS: write more on name-based references
- [ ] verwerk alle TODOs die nog in de tekst staan
- [ ] figures demomodelname.png and demomodelname-with-style.png need to be replaced.
- [ ] add search mechanism on site
- [ ] warn the lang. eng. that when the subcommands (not -all) are used to generate to
 other folders, then the imports will not be correct.
- [ ] pathnames can be used as references (if editor is adjusted)
