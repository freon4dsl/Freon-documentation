Names like Entity are too large, shoulds use either a different font or a lower pointsize.

In current fonmt font-size=10pt looks good at my screen (MacOs Edge)

Also, the yellow background doesn't look good. Maybe leave out the background, or use a more subtle color like very light yellow

- [x] Adjust the configuration: the code should point to a local folder, not a separate package (@freon/)
- [ ] In the scipt shown is old: e.g. it shows "projectit",  this should become "freon".
- [ ] "defs folder" is a link to its own section, this should not be a link at all.
- [ ] Onder Project Structure, onderaan lijstje: webapp bestaat niet meer, aanpassen aan nieuwe situatie.

Page [Model Unit](http://localhost:5173/Documentation/Creating_the_Metamodel/Language_Structure#model-unit-30): Need to explain that a model unit is what you will see in the editor.

Page [concept](http://localhost:5173/Documentation/Creating_the_Metamodel/Language_Structure#model-2): second piece of code "// DocuProject/src/defs/language-main.ast#L106-L112" probably does not belong here.

Page [interface](http://localhost:5173/Documentation/Creating_the_Metamodel/Language_Structure): no example in code.

Page [defining properties](http://localhost:5173/Documentation/Creating_the_Metamodel/Defining_Properties): example code is incorrect min most cases, need to change line numbers.

Page [defining an editor](http://localhost:5173/Documentation/Defining_an_Editor): link for "concrete syntax" 

# General

- [ ] In the right side menu (page specific) if you hover over a line the color becomes yellow, which is badly readable on the white backgrond.
- [ ] I find the term "language structure" not useful.  We should use the term m,etamodel for this, as this is what people commonly do. And then explain once that the metamodel defines the language structure.
- [ ] Why use "simple properties" instead of "primitive properties" ? I would rather use the common primitive properties.
- [ ] Right side menu: if the last two headings are visible on the page, selecting the last one does not do anything. Not a real problem, so may leave it like this.
