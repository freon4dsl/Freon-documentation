We need to upgrade vite-plugin-svelte, but svelteKit still depends on a lower version:
[vite-plugin-svelte] You are using Svelte 5.1.12 with vite-plugin-svelte@3. Active Svelte 5 support has moved to vite-plugin-svelte@4.
        To receive bug fixes and new features update your devDependencies to "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte": "^4.0.0-next.6" and install.
        For framework integrations that depend on it, you might have to add an override:
        "overrides": {"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte": "^4.0.0-next.6"}
