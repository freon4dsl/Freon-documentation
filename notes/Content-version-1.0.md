# Ideas on how to structure the documentation

Four main parts:

- Documentation - what we have so far

- Tutorial - new step by step approach

- Examples - new: to be done

- Demos/Videos - two that are on the main page plus new to be done

All four parts have a different side-nav. Side-nav has two levels: headers and content. 

## Landing page

Should contain direct links to main parts.

Landing page could also contain reference to work by Mike and Graham.

These main parts should also be in the NavBar on top.



## NavBar

Color: Yellow (gold)

Should contain in desktop mode, from left to right:

* Logo

* Title

* Sub-part of site (i.e. Docs, Tut, Exam, Demo)

* Dark/Light mode switch

* Github button

Should contain in mobile mode, from left to right:
