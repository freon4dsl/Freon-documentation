# Customization of the Editor at the API level

At the API level the editor can be changed by implementing two interfaces:
[`FreProjection`](/Under_the_Hood/The_Editor_Framework/The_Editor_Interfaces/FreProjection_Interface) and
[`FreAction`](/Under_the_Hood/The_Editor_Framework/The_Editor_Interfaces/FreAction_Interface). But
before you dive into all this, we suggest that you become familiar with the information
about the [Freon Editor Framework](/Under_the_Hood/The_Editor_Framework).

## Learning More

You can learn how to write projections from [Writing Projections](/Developing_a_Language/API_Level/Writing_Projections).
How to create the action to accompany the projection can be learned from
[Writing Actions'](/Developing_a_Language/API_Level/Writing_Actions).
