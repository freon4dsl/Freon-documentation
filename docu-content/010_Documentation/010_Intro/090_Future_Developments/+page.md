- _Third level adaptability_ per concept for the _scoper_, the _unparser_, and the _parser_.
- Create an _interpreter generator_. A beta version of an interpreter included. More

- Provide a coupling to a _model-to-model generator_.

  structure models.

  from Meinte Boersma.)
- Improve the _diagrammatic view_ of the language definition and make the generation customizable.
