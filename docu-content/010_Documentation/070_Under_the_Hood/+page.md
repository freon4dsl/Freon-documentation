# Under the Hood

Before you dive deeper under the hood of this project, we invite you to read about the
[Background](/Background) used during the creation of this tool.

This section can be roughly divided into three parts.

1. Information about the core [framework](/Documentation/Under_the_Hood/Editor_Framework) of Freon, the classes that
   are used to build the editors.
2. Information on the [interfaces of all fre-tools](/Documentation/Under_the_Hood/FreTool_Interfaces), e.g. the scoper, the validator,
   used and generated by Freon.
3. Information on the (open) source code of Freon can
   be found on <a href="https://github.com/freon4dsl/Freon4dsl" target="_blank">https://github.com/freon4dsl/Freon4dsl</a>.
