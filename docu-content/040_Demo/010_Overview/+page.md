# Welcome to the Demo

On this page you can find links to some of the presentations that were given about Freon. But most importantly you can start
the live <a href='/DocuProjectDemo?model=ShowCase' target='_blank'>demo</a>.

## Live DEMO

To show how a Freon editor might look like, without all kinds of customizations, or a change of CSS styling, we prepared
a demo. The language that was explained in the [documentation](/Documentation/Overview/Running_Example) is used in this example.
It will be no surprise that you cannot use a number of the File menu options.
Use this link to <a href='/DocuProjectDemo?model=ShowCase' target='_blank'><b>Start The Demo</b></a> in a new web page.

## MDENet

On May 31, 2023, we gave a presentation and demonstration for the <a href="https://mde-network.com/" target="_blank">MDENet</a> forum.
Both were recorded. You can find them below.
