# Testimonial

TriRadial Solutions is using Freon for the DSL in or Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) product. 
CRCs are the front-line staff the perform clinical trials for drugs and other health products.
Our product allows a CRC to define the structure of a clinical trial including:

* The phases, e.g., the patient screening, treatment, follow-up phases, etc.
* The visits, e.g., obtain informed consent, conduct physical exam, give medication to patient, etc.
* The tasks to be done in each visit
* The expressions that define the scheduling of all these things

Key features of Freon that we used:
* Its DSL language for CRC DSL
* Its DSL editor framework for the entry of the DSL
* Its interpreter framework to run simulations of the scheduling
  * Its storage framework to load and save the data.

See the example of the product UI below:

    I WILL PUT A PICTURE HERE…

A DSL platform that is optimized for the Web is the void in today’s DSL technology.
Having built DSLs using primitive tools like parsers and language servers as well as high-end tools like MPS, our assessment is that Freon is well on the way to being the ideal balance between these extremes.
The path for integration with the LionWeb project positions Freon for even the most complex projects.

The Freon team has been wonderfully responsive to us when we were getting started and as we’ve made ever more advanced requests for new features.
We would highly recommend using Freon on a DSL project and would be happy to speak with anyone looking to discuss our experience with Freon.
