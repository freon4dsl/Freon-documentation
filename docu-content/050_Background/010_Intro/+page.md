### Why Is Freon As It Is?

Currently, Freon does not support the creation of debuggers, generators, and
such. However, there is a beta version of an interpreter included. More
documentation on this will follow later.
Overall, we have a (large) [wish list](/010_Intro/090_Future_Developments) of extra features
that we would like to implement in the future.

In some cases, like e.g. code generators, we think that integration with existing tools is the best solution.
In other cases we plan to provide Freon components for specific functionality.
Given time, we hope to realize many of these extra items.

If you want to know why
we have chosen this development route, read our statement on the [philosophy](/010_Intro/020_Our_Philosophy)
behind the tool.
