# Understanding the Freon Interpreter Framework

With the language structure explained, we can now focus on the interpreter framework.
In Freon, for every DSL (Domain-Specific Language), the generation step
automatically creates a file named `<<LanguageName>>InterpreterBase.ts`,
which contains the foundational structure for the interpreter.

It includes one evaluation function per concept defined in the language. The first 
parameter of every eval function is the node for which a value needs to be determined.
The second parameter, of type `InterpreterContext`, provides the context in which the expression should be evaluated.
This context is used to store values of constants, variables, etc. so they are available for use in the function. All `eval`
functions are designed to return an object of type `RtObject` (short for "runtime object").
Initially, the base class functions throw an exception when called, as shown here:

```ts
// Expressions/src/freon/interpreter/gen/ExpressionsInterpreterBase.ts#L35-L37

evalNumberLiteralExpression(node: NumberLiteralExpression, ctx: InterpreterContext): RtObject {
    throw new RtError("evalNumberLiteralExpression is not defined");
}
```

## Freonâ€™s Runtime Object Library
We have chosen to always have an `RtObject` (or one of its subclasses) as the result of interpreting, to make sure
that the model (M1) and runtime (M0) levels are always strictly separated.
Of course there can be references from `RtObjects` to instances in the model, e.g. for traceability.
The library provided by Freon contains RtString, RtBoolean, RtArray, and RtError classes,
they are usually extended with domain specific runtime classes.

<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="header">Meta Levels</svelte:fragment>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
In any Domain Specific Language we distinguish the following levels:
<ol>
<li>The language definition, defining which concepts are available. Often called the M2 level.
In Freon this is represented by the language definition in the .ast files.
In Java this would be the Java Language Definition.
</li>   
<li>The model, which contains instances of the  language concepts, called the M1 level.
In Freon this is what you edit in a Freon application.
In Java this would be a Java program consisting of Java classes.
</li>
<li>The runtime level, values resulting from executing or interpreting the model,
called the M0 level.
In Freon this is the result of the interpreter running, or it would be the result of executing code generated from the model (M1) level.
For Java this is the execution of a Java program.
</li>
</ol>
</svelte:fragment></Note>



Freon provides a set of runtime classes that can be used out-of-the-box or extended to fit your domain-specific needs. These include:
- **`RtNumber`**: Represents numeric values.
- **`RtString`**: Represents strings.
- **`RtBoolean`**: Represents boolean values.
- **`RtArray`**: Represents arrays.
- **`RtError`**: Represents errors.

You can also create domain-specific runtime classes that inherit from these foundational classes. Additionally, runtime objects may contain references to model instances (e.g., for traceability purposes).

By following this structured approach, you can easily build and customize interpreters for your DSLs using Freon. Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific aspect!

## Interpreter Context
Every node in the AST is evaluated within a certain context, represented by the `ctx: InterpreterContext` parameter.

If we refer to a paremeter in the body of a function, we need to know the value of the parameter. This is done thtough the cointext as follows:

```ts
// Expressions/src/custom/interpreter/ExpressionsInterpreter.ts#L56-L65

override evalFunctionCallExpression(node: FunctionCallExpression, ctx: InterpreterContext): RtObject {
    const calledFunction = node.$calledFunction;
    const functionContext = new InterpreterContext(ctx);
    node.arguments.forEach((arg, index) => {
        const argumentValue = main.evaluate(arg, ctx);
        // Add the parameter to the context with the value of the evaluated argument
        functionContext.set(calledFunction.parameters[index], argumentValue);
    });
    return main.evaluate(calledFunction, functionContext);
}
```
The evaluation of the function call expression has two pparts.
In the first part a new InterpreterContext is created with the original context as its parent. 
This way everything in the original context is available as well.

Then all the arguments of the function call are evaluated and their value is stored in the context with the corresponding parameter as its key.

Now the function is evaluated `main.evaluate(calledFunction, functionContext)` with the new
context as parameter.

If we come across a `ParameterRef` inside the evaluation of the function body,
this evaluation can simply lookup the value of the parameter: 

```ts
// Expressions/src/custom/interpreter/ExpressionsInterpreter.ts#L71-L73

override evalParameterRef(node: ParameterRef, ctx: InterpreterContext): RtObject {
    return ctx.find(node.$parameter);
}
```
Note that the value of the parameter lookup will be different for different calls to the function.
Which is exactly what we need.

A full example of running the interpreter for the following model:
This example has one function `range`  and two expressions.
When running the interpreter the Freon editor shows a trace of the evaluation in the Interpreter tab as shown.
In the trace you can find two Function evaluations.
At the end of the lines with Function the context is shown with different valuies for the start and end parameters
for each function call.

Interpreters can do more than just calculate with numbers, they can be made to run tests or generate HTML and show the result somewhere in the editor.
