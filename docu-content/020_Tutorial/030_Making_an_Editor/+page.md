# Making an Editor for your DSL

At last, your patience is rewarded. In this step of the tutorial we are going to make the editor looking great!

## The default editor

Let's create a file called `edu-subjects.edit` in the `src/defs` folder,
and define a default editor for this model unit. Please, enter the following line.

```txt
// Education/lesson2-defs/edu-topics.edit#L3-L3

editor default
```

There, that's done!

No, of course we are not done. Just kidding, and showing you that Freon will add a default [projection](Documentation/Editor/Projections) for any concept that is not
included in the editor definition. You can build your editor concept by concept.

In fact the editor that is generated in lesson 1, is completely based on the defaults generated by Freon.

## A projection for the _Topic_ model unit

Again, we focus on the _Topic_ model unit first. Let's state how this model unit should look. To define a projection
we need the name of the concept, some curly brackets, and, last but not least a pair of square brackets. Everything
that goes between the square brackets is the projection. It will be taken as literal as possible into the editor, that is,
if there is indentation or literal text, this will be projected as unchangeable strings.

The projection for _Topic_ consists of four parts.

- A line with the fixed
  string 'Subject:' followed by the name of the subject. For the latter we use a syntax similar to the smart
  strings in TypeScript: `${self.topic}`. You may leave out the 'self.' part. It indicates that we refer to the property of the _Topic_ object
  that is projected. For clarity, we will be using this prefix everywhere in the tutorial.
- A line with the fixed string 'Topic:' followed by the name of the unit. 
- The third line is similar to the first, but projects the `description` property of the model unit. Next, we add an empty line
  which, like the indentation, will show in the editor.
- The last part of the definition gives the projection of the `pages` property, which is a list. By adding the keyword `vertical`
  we tell Freon to project the list vertically.

```txt
// Education/lesson2-defs/edu-topics.edit#L3-L16

editor default

Topic {[
    Subject: ${self.subject}
    Topic: ${self.name}
    Topic description: ${self.description}

    Pages:
    ${self.pages vertical }
]}

Page {[
    ${self.name}
]}
```

## The Possibilities for Lists

Above we have projected the pages as a list. There are many ways to do this. First, not all lists need to be
projected vertically. Use the keyword `horizontal` to display all list elements on a single line.
The keyword may also be omitted, the default value is `vertical`.

Next, we create a projection for _Theory_. Note that the line of dashes will also appear in the editor.

```txt
Theory {[
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Theory
        ${self.content vertical terminator[== END OF LINE]}

    Questions:
        ${self.questions vertical}
]}

```

You might have noticed that we added something to the projection of `self.content` in the 
above definition: `terminator[== END OF LINE]`. It means that
after every element of the list the string '== END OF LINE' character is projected.

You could also opt for using a `separator`, a character
or string to be projected between the elements of the list. Another option is the `initiator`, which project
the character or string before the element.

Here are some examples of how you can tweak the display.

```txt
    Theory
        ${self.contents vertical separator [.]}

    Theory
        ${self.content horizontal terminator [====]}

    Theory
        ${self.content vertical initiator [Line]}
]}
```

Go ahead and try the different options. 

## Inherited Projections

Remember that we defined the concept `Page` to be abstract, and there were a lot of concepts that inherit from `Page`? Of course,
we can build inherited projection definitions as well. We have defined the projection for the abstract concept `Page` as follows.
It's nothing fancy, but you could do more, if you like.

```txt
// Education/lesson2-defs/edu-topics.edit#L14-L16

Page {[
    ${self.name}
]}
```

Now look at how we incorporate this projection in the projection of one of `Page`'s children using this syntax: `[=>Page]`. It means
that we will include the default projection of _Page_ right there.
Note that we can use 
inherited properties, like `questions`, as expected in the projection.

```txt
// Education/lesson2-defs/edu-topics.edit#L18-L25

Theory {[
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Theory [=>Page]
        ${self.content vertical terminator[== END OF LINE]}

    Questions:
        ${self.questions vertical}
]}
```

Now we can almost finish the projection for this model unit by adding the following lines.

```txt
// Education/lesson2-defs/edu-topics.edit#L27-L76

Video {[
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Video [=>Page]
        Maybe this video will help you understand.
        ${self.url}

    Questions:
        ${self.questions vertical}
]}

WorkSheet {[
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Worksheet [=>Page]
        See if you can answer the following questions.

    Questions:
        ${self.questions vertical}
]}

ExamplePage {[
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Example [=>Page]
        ${self.content}

        Now, please, answer the following questions.

    Questions:
        ${self.questions vertical}
]}

InDepthMaterial {[
    ----------------------------------------------------
    InDepthMaterial [=>Page]
        ${self.content}

        Test your understanding by answering the following questions.

    Questions:
        ${self.questions vertical}
]}

Question {[
    ${self.name}
        ${self.content}
        Correct Answer: ${self.correctAnswer}
]}

Line {
    [${self.content}]
}
```

## Triggers

Last thing to learn in this lesson is how we can make editing easier for the user. Remember that we needed a concept for numeric fractions?
Its called `Fraction`, and it is formed by combining two numbers, a numerator and a denominator.

```txt
// Education/lesson2-defs/edu-topics.ast#L53-l56

anguage Education

modelunit Topic {
    name: identifier;
    reference subject: Subject;
    description: string;
    pages: Page[];
}

abstract concept Page {
    name: identifier;
    questions: Question[];
}

concept Theory base Page {
    /* For the sake of the example this is simplified.
    Should be formatted text including pictures, etc. */
    content: Line[];
}

concept Line { // todo use MultiLine Component
    content: string;
}

concept Video base Page {
    url: string;
}

concept WorkSheet base Page {
}

concept ExamplePage base Page {
    content: Line[];
}

concept InDepthMaterial base Page {
    content: Line[];
}

concept Question {
    name: identifier;
    content: string;
    correctAnswer: NumberConcept;
}

abstract concept NumberConcept {
}

concept SimpleNumber base NumberConcept {
    value: number;
}

concept Fraction base NumberConcept {
    numerator: number;
    denominator: number;
}

```

In Freon the user must first choose the Fraction option from a dropdown menu before he/she can enter any number. To avoid
this extra step in editing, we can tell Freon that when a certain key or string is entered, it should automatically create an instance of
the associated concept. The key or string to be entered is called the **trigger**.

For the Fraction concept we defined the trigger to be a forwards slash. If the user wants to add a correct answer to a question, 
where the possibilities are either a _SimpleNumber_ or a _Fraction_, entering the '/' will produce a _Fraction_ instance.


```txt
// Education/lesson2-defs/edu-topics.edit#L78-L85

SimpleNumber {
    [${self.value}]
}

Fraction {
    [${numerator} / ${denominator}]
    trigger = "/"
}
```

Go ahead, and generate a new editor and have a look. Your editor should now look like this. Much better than the result from lesson 1!

<Figure
imageName={'Tutorial-lesson2-screenshot2.png'}
caption={'Editor after adding some projection definitions'}
figureNumber={1}
/>

When you've gotten this far, it might be a good idea to try for yourself what
happens if you change the projection, for instance, you might switch the order of the lines. 
But don't forget to get back to 
the next part of the tutorial, where we will have more fun with defining projections.
