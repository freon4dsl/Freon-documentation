# Congratulations!!!

When you have reached this point, you have learned all the basics of Freon. What's more, you have produced
a web-based editor with just 501 lines of code, containing 9547 characters, including
comments. (Yes, we counted them!)

## What to do next?

There are a number of paths to follow if you want to continue learning about Freon, and creating DSLs. Of course, 
you can have a browse through the [documentation](/Documentation/Overview), where many of the topics we discussed 
in this tutorial are explained in depth. Or you could dive deeper into the Computer Aided Learning DSL, by 
extending the DSL with more ideas. Below you will find a [list of suggestions](/Tutorial/Conclusion#ideas-to-extend-the-dsl3) for extending the language.
Another option is to have a look at the list of [examples](/Examples/Overview) included on this site. Each example 
takes a deeper dive into a specific part of Freon. Or check out [LionWeb](/LionWeb/Overview),
to know more about model and language interchange formats between various tools for language engineering. 

If you are really into Freon, you could also join the team of contributors. 

## Ideas to extend the DSL

We conclude this tutorial with some suggestions on how to proceed with the Computer Aided Learning DSL.

- Introduce questions that can have a boolean as answer.
E.g. Can this fraction be simplified: 13/139?
- Try to use styling to change the appearance of the editor.
See the documentation about [styling](/Documentation/Defining_an_Editor/Styling)
